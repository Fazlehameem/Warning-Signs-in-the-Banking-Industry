# Warning Signs in the Banking Industry
![bank](https://media.brstatic.com/2017/03/20164944/what-happens-when-bank-fails-1-intro-lg.jpg)

In this project, we utilize Python visualizations to create an interactive dashboard examining the differences in loan concentrations between active banks that made it through the 2008-2010 global financial crisis and those that failed that in that timeframe or in the years thereafter.  Our main focus is on how the banks that managed to make it through the financial crisis positioned their loan portfolios compared to those that didn't make it through - what were the differences in concentrations?  For banks that failed, were they too heavily concentrated in one particular area?  Did excessive risk lead to failure?  We want currently active banks to be able to look at this analysis and glean relevant information they can then use to better allocate their loan portfolio.

Team members include Ben Fischler, Mitchel Voloshin, Lisa Esberger, Brendan Shanley and Fazle Hameem.

## Question 2: What role did the concentrations play in the failure of banking firms over the last 20 years?


## Question 3: What trends, if any, were discovered that eventually led to bank insolvency?


## Question 4: How can this data be used by investors or by firm management to make future operational decisions?
