In this project, we utilize Python visualizations to create an interactive dashboard examining the financial differences between successful banks, and those that have failed.  We want currently active, successful banks to be able to look at this analysis and glean relevant information they can then use to better manage their money because they see how failed banks did so.

Team members include Ben Fischler, Mitchel Voloshin, Lisa Esberger, Brendan Shanley and Fazle Hameem.
